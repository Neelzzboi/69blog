    <p class = "text-muted"> I went to New York during the late Spring. To be honest, it was a very fun place to be in. I saw a lot of interesting sculptures. One of the best ones was the Statue of Liberty. I walked around it and saw a close-up of it. It was really interesting. I definitely recommend going to New York. Not just because of the Statue of Liberty, but also because of the many other interesting things there.</p>

    <p class = "text-muted"> I went to Taupo when it was a cooling 15 degrees celsius. It had a beautiful view of the huge lake and the tiny towns on the river banks. I feel that the town of Taupo was far more beautiful than the ones I normally see. It has been an amazing sight at Taupo. Along with New York, this is also a must-go-to place. I definitely recommend this to everyone.</p>

        <p> When I first heard about Minions: Rise of Gru, I was bloody excited! The last Minions movie came about five whole years ago, so it really shocked me when this new movie came out. I recently went to the cinema to check it out. Oh damn, this movie was amazing! It was filled with a mixture of suspense, cuteness, fun and joy. It was an hour and a half well spent. </p>

        <p> Initially, I did not know about this movie. While I was on the plane to New Zealand, my father recommended this movie to me. At first, it seemed too difficult to understand when I read the synopsis. But when I watched the movie, it was really interesting and very funny (at times). One thing the writers of the movie could improve on is the gore in the show (that is why I rated a 4 out of 5). Otherwise, I enjoyed it very much and I definitely recommend this movie to you. </p>
